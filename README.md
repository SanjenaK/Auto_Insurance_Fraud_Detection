# Auto Insurance Fraud Detection

The Auto Insurance Claims dataset was obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/buntyshah/auto-insurance-claims-data.  

Using the Auto Insurance Claims dataset, the aim was to train and evaluate classification models in predicting the target variable, 'fraud_reported' (whether a fraud was reported or not) for auto insurance claims.
